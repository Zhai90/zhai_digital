# Hello fellow visitor!

**I have absolutely no idea how you got here, or why you got here,**
**but I guess it's maybe for information about the page... Oh well, let's get started!**

--> `LICENSE.MD`

- That's the copyright license and stuff. It's a MIT License if you were wondering.

--> `TODO.md`

- Man... it's just there okay? I don't know what to do with it. Maybe some day there'll be something, keep your eyes peeled!

--> `.gitignore`

- It does absolutely nothing at the moment, and I don't think it ever will.

--> `README.md`

- There's a person reading it... most likely you.

--> `index.html`

- Hey look, something useful.

--> `index.css`

- I just called it that way, oh well, it's the styling for the main page. Ye happeh?

--> `script.js`

- Javascript, something I'm still learning (actually I'm learning all 3 HTML, CSS and JS).

<--- `./mystuff/...` --->

--> `index.html`

- Self explanatory I believe (it's just the old page but revamped).

--> `mystuff.css`

- Yeah... the styles... right?

--> `mystuff.js`

- Wow, such empty!

<--- `./bootstrap` --->

--> `literally everything in there`

- Bootstrap, JQuery and Popper libraries.

__Would you look at that! That's all for now, if you have anything to tell me, DM me on **Discord** which is `Zhai_#9998`. See ya there!__
